## Stuplus - App API, Backoffice(Admin panel) API and Frontend, Image Service


The main purpose of Stuplus is to be a communication tool among university students, to reflect the thoughts of the students and to deliver all kinds of announcements about their education life. University students using the application find people in their departments and meet if they have not met, and interact if they do. Stuplus's long-term goal is to be the social media for students.
